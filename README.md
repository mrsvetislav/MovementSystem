Hi to all!
I am new to php and I would like to create some kind of movement simulation software. I love robots and that is what is all of this about.  
I will try to find a way around mathematic here so bassically once I have all formulas, I will put them inside of classes withou to think againe about it.
This should be something like embedded software package that can be usefull in real world problems, robot programing! I hope to get some help here : ))))
